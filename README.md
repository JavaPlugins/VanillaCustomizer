## Issues reports [here](https://github.com/PluginBugs/Issues-VanillaCustomizer/issues)


* Customize the vanilla game items without touching them. All changes are only visual and won't interfere in any way with any plugin or game logic.
* Edit other plugin items in case the other plugin doesn't allow to change display name, lore, material, custom_model_data and more.
* Add custom graphical tags (usually called "glyphs" or font images) to ANY item.
* All customization won't cause the item to become unstackable.
* Change item graphical attributes in future updates even for already crafted/obtained player items.
* Give your players more information about what an item can be used for.
* Put some server events information on items. For example show a tag in the lore of every item required during a Christmas quests.
